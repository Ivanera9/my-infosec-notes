🧠 Day 10 — Linux Command Mastery & TryHackMe Kickoff


⚙️ Overview

After stabilizing the Kali environment and repairing repositories, today’s session was all about sharpening hands-on control over Linux and stepping into real cybersecurity learning with TryHackMe.

This day was dedicated to mastering essential terminal commands and completing the introductory rooms in TryHackMe — covering offensive, defensive, and career-based cybersecurity paths.

🔹 Objectives

Build muscle memory for core Linux commands.

Practice real terminal navigation and file manipulation.

Understand command documentation and self-help methods (man, --help).

Begin structured cybersecurity learning through TryHackMe.

🔹 Command-Line Practice

Commands practiced directly inside Kali (with practical testing on files and directories):

Command	Function
pwd	Show current working directory
cd	Change directory
ls	List contents of a directory
mkdir	Create a new directory
rmdir	Remove an empty directory
cp	Copy files or folders
rm	Remove files or folders
locate	Quickly find files using the system database
updatedb	Update file search database
passwd	Change user password
man	Open manual pages for any command

✅ Combined commands (like cd && ls) and tested command chaining.
✅ Practiced searching manual pages (/keyword) and navigation using q to exit.
✅ Learned hidden file access (ls -a) and recursive removal (rm -r).

🔹 TryHackMe Exploration

Started with the three foundation rooms/lobbies:

🕵️ Offensive Security Introduction — attacker mindset, penetration testing process.

🛡️ Defensive Security Introduction — log analysis, detection, and system protection.

💼 Career Pathway Overview — cybersecurity job roles and industry skill mapping.

✅ Accounts configured and rooms completed successfully.
✅ Understood the balance between red team (attack) and blue team (defense) thinking.

🔹 Outcome

Confident in essential Linux file navigation and system management.

Command documentation and self-learning workflow established.

TryHackMe platform fully set up and operational.

Gained the first structured understanding of cybersecurity learning paths.

🧭 Reflection

This was the first true skill day — where knowledge directly translated to technical control.
Everything from here builds on this base: every exploit, scan, and privilege escalation depends on solid terminal fluency.

“The command line isn’t just a tool — it’s how hackers see the world.”
