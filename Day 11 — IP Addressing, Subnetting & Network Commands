🧠 Day 11 — IP Addressing, Subnetting & Network Commands



⚙️ Overview

Today was focused entirely on core networking fundamentals — the things every hacker MUST understand before touching tools like Nmap, Wireshark, ARP spoofing, or packet analysis.
I studied IP addressing concepts, classifications, subnetting logic, default gateway behavior, and then validated everything by running actual commands inside Kali Linux.

🔹 Topics Learned
1. IP Address Basics

Structure of IPv4: 32 bits → 4 octets

Private vs Public IP ranges

Static vs Dynamic IPs

Difference between IP address, MAC address, and Hostname

2. Classes of IP Addresses (A, B, C)

Class A: 1.0.0.0 – 126.0.0.0 (Large networks)

Class B: 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.0.0 (Medium networks)

Class C: 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.0 (Small networks)

Also learned: Class D (multicast) and Class E (experimental)

3. Subnetting Fundamentals

Subnet mask purpose

/ notation (CIDR) — how /24, /16, /20, /30 etc. work

How subnetting splits networks for security & efficiency

Calculated:

Network address

Broadcast address

Range of valid hosts

(Not advanced subnetting yet — just foundation.)

4. Default Gateway

Learned the role of the gateway:

It routes packets outside your LAN

Every device forwards external traffic → Router → Internet

Verified default gateway using Linux tools

5. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

Maps IP → MAC

How devices discover each other on LAN

Learned how ARP spoofing works in theory (no attacks performed)

Ran ARP table lookup inside Kali

🔹 Practical Commands Run on Kali Linux
Check IP address & interfaces:
ip a


(Verified interface eth0 / wlan0 depending on VM)

Check default gateway:
ip route
route -n

ARP table:
arp -a

Network connectivity tests:
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
ping -c 3 google.com

Checked interface names & states:
ip link show


Everything executed successfully — networking on the VM is working normally.

🔹 Outcome

Built a correct mental model of how devices communicate in a network.

Understood the absolute basics that future tools depend on.

Gained confidence using ip and route commands instead of old ifconfig.

Now ready for Day 12 topics like:

Nmap basics

OSI model deep dive

ping, traceroute, netstat

DHCP & DNS fundamentals

🧭 Reflection

Networking isn’t “fun” at first, but it’s the foundation for hacking.
Without understanding IP, subnetting, ARP, and routes, you can’t scan networks, can’t exploit correctly, and can’t debug anything.
Today was about building that foundation — so when I start the real tools, I actually know what’s happening behind the scenes.
