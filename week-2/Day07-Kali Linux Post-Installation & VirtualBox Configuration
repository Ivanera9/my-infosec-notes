🧠 Day 7 — Kali Linux Post-Installation & VirtualBox Configuration


⚙️ Overview

Following the base installation completed on Day 6, today’s focus was on getting Kali Linux fully operational inside VirtualBox.
Most of the effort went into configuring the desktop environment, enabling integration features, and stabilizing performance for consistent use.

🎯 Objectives

Bring up the graphical interface (XFCE)

Install and enable VirtualBox Guest Additions for display, clipboard, and drag-drop features

Verify network connectivity and system health

Optimize VM hardware allocation and performance

🧩 Work Summary
🖥️ Display Manager Fix

Initially, the VM booted to a non-GUI terminal.
To restore the graphical login screen (LightDM):

sudo apt install lightdm -y
sudo systemctl enable lightdm
sudo systemctl start lightdm


✅ After reboot, successfully logged into the XFCE desktop environment.

💽 VirtualBox Guest Additions

Inserted Guest Additions ISO, mounted, and installed essential modules:

sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r) -y
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/cdrom
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
cd /mnt/cdrom
sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run


Verification:

lsmod | grep vbox


Output confirmed vboxguest and vboxsf modules were active.
🟢 Clipboard and display resizing features worked as expected after reboot.

⚙️ Performance Tuning

Adjusted VirtualBox resource settings for smooth operation:

Parameter	Setting
RAM	4 GB
CPU Cores	2
Video Memory	128 MB
Acceleration	3D Enabled
Clipboard	Bidirectional

These changes significantly improved responsiveness and graphics stability.

🌐 System & Network Checks

Ran key diagnostic commands:

whoami
uname -a
ifconfig
ping -c 3 google.com


✅ Result:
Network and base system fully operational; outbound connectivity verified.

🧾 Outcome
Component	Status
XFCE Desktop	✅ Running smoothly
Guest Additions	✅ Installed & functional
Clipboard / Display Sync	✅ Working
Network	✅ Stable
VM Performance	⚡ Noticeably improved
🧭 Reflection

Expected this phase to be quick, but fine-tuning the display manager and VirtualBox integration took deeper troubleshooting.
The process gave insight into how the virtualization layer interacts with the Linux kernel, display drivers, and modules.

Toward the end of the session, the Windows host entered recovery mode, causing minor delays.
This will be consolidated into the next log entry — covering recovery steps and continued configuration stability testing.
